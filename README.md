# ScoopsWhoops
Scoops Whoops is a fun game in which kids swipe left and right the device to catch and stack scoops of ice cream scoops. Game's clear, singular goal and easy-to-use interface will keep kids entertained.


#Overall thinking and approach to this game : Since the game theme was " You dropped your ice cream", so I choose with a game theme with falling scoops and a cone to catch it. Scoops will keep stacking on each other. If player, misses any scoops, the game will be over. The level of the game gradually increases with incresed falling speed of scoops and increased number of scoops.

#Known issues & solutions : 
- UIController can be a seperate script to mange UI
- With too many scoops scene can be heavy, 
- It can be optimised for different resolutions
- HUD Screen desgins can be improved
- There's possibilty if a big stack of scoop is made , it might can break. Solution : We wil limit the stack shown to user at a given time.

#Improvements : 

1. Game Play Mechanics : The sliding of cone can be improved, we can make it on phone tilting or swiping as an additional controls.
2. Game Play : We can have different gameplay modes like Arcade, Endless, Campaign modes. 
- In Arcade user will have several objects like burger, pancakes, cakes and scoops and Player need to dodge all the other objects except scoops.
- In Campaign mode : Player will be given a pattern that he need to make to complete the level. For eg: Blue ,White, Red , Blue scoops. Making wrong pattern results in game over.
- Endless Mode : In this mode, player need to catch as many scops and go as much further he/she can.
- Music and SFX is must to have an engaging gameplay.
- Powerups (Magnet to catch all scoops, Extra life, Auto-Pilot mode) and theme are other important aspects that can be added as well.


#Desgins :
Since this game is intended for age group 7-8. So to keep enegaing for this age group iwe cna offer a clear set of instructions, with opportunities to interpret and explore them. So, though the game objective is to collect all scoops, but every kid can make their own combinations of scoops and save them in photos which they can print out later and it facilitate proud moments. Also we can let kids of this age to earn and collect awards, so every scoop they collect fetch them a scoring point which in future updates can be used to coolect different cones, background which Incorporate positive progression.

Also kids of this age prefer to be in control of the game, so they can control theri game progression as well.
